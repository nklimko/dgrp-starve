Grouping model:
group 1: filter genotype by lines of interest
group 2: filter genotype by lines not of interest

for all four main groups()

calculate mean of SNP for every SNP for each subgroup -> 2x1.8mil table


ratio (group1)/(group2+1e-9) so any zero doesn''t throw an error

arrange ratios and grab top/bottom 100 and save 



0.00000000001
1e-9

any value greater than 1 has higher SNP variation?? unsure of what data indicates
value close to zero indicates knockout in group of interest
