### 2022/12/21

•	Fit data to model using starvation resistance vector

•	Reorganize site to hyperlinks from main index rather than new pages every week

•	Next meeting will be January 10th at CHG

•	Merry Christmas!


### 2022/12/14

•	Fix x axis uniform distribution label: incorrect.

•	Inflection in qq plot indicates inflation of p-values.

•	Address this by using mixed model of fixed effect and random effect.

•	Sample data will be sent later on how to perform this with simulated data.

•	Send shift schedule to plan next week’s meeting.


### 2022/12/06

•	Fix correlations: lm not reading in data properly, p-values wrong

•	Add -log10 scale on qqplot, not just Manhattan plot

•	qqman package for both qqplot and Manhattan plot

•	Next meeting Wednesday, Dec. 14th 2:30-3:00 via Zoom due to exams.


### 2022/11/29

•	Use gene expression data to preform simple regression with starvation resistance.

•	Run summary(lm(y~x)) for starvation resistance against gene expression for each gene in both sexes.

•	p-value of slope can be accessed from `summary()[[4]][8]`

•	Create a -10 log scale QQ-plot for a uniform distribution versus p-values.

•	Determine why this statistical approach is inappropriate.


### 2022/11/22

•	Multiple comparison scatter plots should be sex specific.

•	PCA should be performed with genotype data, not gene expression.

  o Calculate mean expression and variance for gene expression.
  
  o	Scatter plot of overlapping genes between males and females.
  
  o	Count # of genes expressed in males, females, and both.  
  
  
### 2022/11/15

•	Continue multiple comparisons with trendlines, multiple tips:

  o	cor.test() for summary statistics
  
  o	List notation to store ggplots
  
  o	Use print() with ggplot, cowplot for grid arrangement
  
•	Try to find an efficient method for column means of gene expression

•	Principal Component analysis – begin brainstorming

•	Discuss further PhD plans mid-February  

  
### 2022/11/11

•	Presented starvation analysis of DGRP lines

  o	Include “code_folding: hide” in yaml headers for Rmd
  
  o	Include variance in results
  
•	Multiple comparison of starvation against all other traits

•	Perform analysis of gene expression by line


### 2022/11/01

•	Get creative with analysis – scatterplot trendline, normality, beyond

•	WorkflowR from cmd line, develop website

•	Base repositories in /data/morgante_lab/nklimko instead of home drive

•	Next meeting Friday the 11th at 10am by Zoom due to election


### 2022/10/26

•	Set github ssh keys and config settings on personal laptop and secretariat

•	Recap of workflowR and walkthrough of model layout 

•	Introductory project to analyze starvation resistance trait in male and female lines on computational node in secretariat. 

•	Postdoctoral candidate meeting and seminar on Wed 10/27 – provide feedback on both candidates


### 2022/10/18

•	Presented SNP Prediction Paper on Plant and Animal breeding

•	Begin working with github and workflowR to begin data processing in upcoming weeks


### 2022/10/04

•	Create simple presentation for https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/193/2/327.full.pdf by 10/11 - build habit of summarizing papers/distilling main points

•	Class selection: Adv. Biochem, Seminar, Intro to Quant Gen, and Regression + Least Squares

  o	Consult on further class selection semester basis
  
•	Talk with Dr. Starr-Moss regarding credit hours for master’s research – three recommended
  

### 2022/09/27

•	Review of Presentation for https://academic.oup.com/g3journal/article/10/12/4599/6048688

  o	Transcriptome data higher accuracy than SNP variation
  
  o	External data boosts prediction accuracy of transcriptome alone(TBLUP vs GO-TBLUP)
  
  o	Redundancy of genome and transcriptome – additive vs non-additive
  
•	Complete final Dataquest subunit by Friday

•	Review https://www.genetics.org/content/genetics/193/2/327.full.pdf
  

### 2022/09/13

•	Goal to complete R modules on Dataquest by 9/30: Dataquest is paid software

•	Read two papers focused on DGRP creation and usage

•	Begin reading additional paper for class presentation

•	Meeting time shift to 2:30pm for travel considerations
